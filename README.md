## 💡 In this project I have added more Functionality⚙️ and Accessibility♿️🧏🧑‍🦯 features to the webpage for:
    Horiseon- Social Solutions Services, Inc.
    © 2019 Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

</br>

## Some Functionality and Accessibility features I have added within the HTML and CSS code are as follows:
    
### ✖️ added a necessary title for the browser to show

### ✖️ added Semantic HTML elements for smoother and more descriptive human- and machine-reading of the code

### ✖️ added descriptive and concise alternatives for a screen-reader to read (or not to read) to the user when scanning images on the page

### ✖️ changed many font-sizes for better visability

### ✖️ added some CSS Selectors/Rules for certain issues

### 🤝 consolidated multiple unnecessary CSS Selectors

### ❌ eliminated some very repetitive code

### 📝 renamed existing CSS Selectors to names that are more logical

### 🔗 used identifiers for better navigation

### ✖️ added indications (in the form of comments) for the different section's beginning and end points-- making it easier to edit the code in the future if needed

</br>

### 📑 additions, edits, etc., are commented throughout the HTML and CSS code

</br>

### 📚 I owe credit and thanks to the following resources for helping me with my project:
    - MDN Web Docs, for the many pages I referenced regarding the topic of "Accessibility" and "CSS Posistioning"
    - Many AskBCS Learning Assistants in Slack, for solutions to issues resulting from code errors
    - My instructor Slavic, for the knowledge I gained from his classes
    - The OSU Coding Bootcamp's Module 1, for the knowledge I gained from its lessons
    - Youtube, for many intructional "how-to" videos
    - Lastly, and certainly not least-- Google, for all the questions I needed quick answers for
